# myCoolSnippets
A collection of helpful Javascript snippets (with the exception of a few VIM snippets) that I use in my day-to-day development. Contains snippets for ES6, NodeJS, React, Socket.io, Mongoose, MongoDB and more. I update these regularly according to my development needs. Since these are useful for me, I figured they might be useful for others as well... so help yourself!

The project name "myCoolSnippets" is a tribute to the [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) documentation, section `3.3 Snippet Search Path`.

***DISCLAIMER: contains snippets I've personally wrote and others collected over the years from other snippet collections (primarily [vim-snippets](https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets)) and I may not be the original author for all these snippets.*** 


## Background
Editing speed is one of the main reasons why I love using the VIM editor. There was a time when I use to be very selective about which plugins I installed and which plugin options I would enable. Too many plugins would slow VIM down and too few plugins meant I'd be missing out on some of the fun :disappointed:. Switching to [NEOVIM](https://neovim.io/) *(rather reluctantly at first, being my stubborn self)* addressed the speed issues I experienced with VIM. NEOVIM supports asynchronous plugins which drastically reduces the performance cost of using plugins. Snippets have become a critical part of my work flow and the [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) snippets engine and indispensable tool in my programming arsenal.
